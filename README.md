# Pewlett Hackard Employee Analysis
This was a fun project utilizing all that we have learned including:
* Excell
* SQL (created by pgAdmin, Servers hosted with postgreSQL)
* Python (utilizing jupyter notebook to write code, display results/figures, save figures locally)
## Work Performed
* Created 6 tables in server and uplod corrisponding data to tables
* Created Pewlet_DBD (Database Diagram) using quickDataBaseDiagrams.com
* Assigned Primary Keys (PK) and Foriegn Keys (FK) to table Schemas
* Saved Schema to new SQL file named pewlett_schema
* Performed Queries to answer various questions from management
* Created new SQL table with combined data I though was relevant
* Connected PostgreSQL servers to my Jupyter Notebook and preformed more data analysis in Jupyter
# Findings
* More than 22k employees were hired in 1986 (thats in insane)
* There are only 24 managers in the whole company and over 40k employee records (thats also insane)
*  20 Employees have the first name hercules and also have a last name that starts with B (all the last names are suspiciously similar)
